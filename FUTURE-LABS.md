# Future Labs

As we create and deliver these Labs, we identify areas where we can aid understanding by delving deeper into another topic.

Topics we've identified which would make for a great Lab in the future:
- Docker
- The various ways to interact with AWS - (Account setup, access keys usage)

## Suggestions
If you have a suggestion for a Lab, please raise a GitHub issue against this file.
Please bare in mind, these Labs are open source - you are more than welcome to raise a PR to introduce a new Lab.
